# 🏏 Cricket With Numbers Game

This is my **first-ever self-coded Python game**, inspired by the sport of cricket.  
Built entirely with beginner-level Python concepts and a lot of passion!

## 🎮 Game Features:
- Toss logic using ODD/EVEN system
- Batting and Bowling innings simulation
- Wickets, targets, and **tie-breaker rounds**
- Fully terminal-based gameplay

---

## 🔧 Built With:
- Python
- Random module
- Conditional statements
- Loops, input validation, and custom game flow

---

## 🙌 Why I Made This:
I wanted to challenge myself by building something fun using just the basics of Python.  
No copy-paste — just raw effort and learning. This game helped me understand flow control, thinking in logic, and handling user inputs.
